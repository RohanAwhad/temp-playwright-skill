description: Complete browser automation with Playwright. Auto-detects dev servers, writes clean test scripts to /tmp. Test pages, fill forms, take screenshots, check responsive design, validate UX, test login flows, check links, automate any browser task. Use when user wants to test websites, automate browser interactions, validate web functionality, or perform any browser-based testing.
---

**IMPORTANT - Path Resolution:**
This skill can be installed in different locations (plugin system, manual installation, global, or project-specific). Before executing any commands, determine the skill directory based on where you loaded this SKILL.md file, and use that path in all commands below. Replace `$SKILL_DIR` with the actual discovered path.

Common installation paths:

- Plugin system: `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/playwright-skill/skills/playwright-skill`
- Manual global: `~/.claude/skills/playwright-skill`
- Project-specific: `<project>/.claude/skills/playwright-skill`

# Playwright Browser Automation

General-purpose browser automation skill. I'll write custom Playwright code for any automation task you request and execute it via the universal executor.

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW - Follow these steps in order:**

1. **Auto-detect dev servers** - For localhost testing, ALWAYS run server detection FIRST:

   ```bash
   cd $SKILL_DIR && node -e "require('./lib/helpers').detectDevServers().then(servers => console.log(JSON.stringify(servers)))"
   ```

   - If **1 server found**: Use it automatically, inform user
   - If **multiple servers found**: Ask user which one to test
   - If **no servers found**: Ask for URL or offer to help start dev server

2. **Write scripts to /tmp** - NEVER write test files to skill directory; always use `/tmp/playwright-test-*.js`

3. **Use visible browser by default** - Always use `headless: false` unless user specifically requests headless mode

4. **Parameterize URLs** - Always make URLs configurable via environment variable or constant at top of script

## How It Works

1. You describe what you want to test/automate
2. I auto-detect running dev servers (or ask for URL if testing external site)
3. I write custom Playwright code in `/tmp/playwright-test-*.js` (won't clutter your project)
4. I execute it via: `cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js /tmp/playwright-test-*.js`
5. Results displayed in real-time, browser window visible for debugging
6. Test files auto-cleaned from /tmp by your OS

## Setup (First Time)

```bash
cd $SKILL_DIR
npm run setup
```

This installs Playwright and Chromium browser. Only needed once.

## Execution Pattern

**Step 1: Detect dev servers (for localhost testing)**

```bash
cd $SKILL_DIR && node -e "require('./lib/helpers').detectDevServers().then(s => console.log(JSON.stringify(s)))"
```

**Step 2: Write test script to /tmp with URL parameter**

```javascript
// /tmp/playwright-test-page.js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

// Parameterized URL (detected or user-provided)
const TARGET_URL = 'http://localhost:3001'; // <-- Auto-detected or from user

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.goto(TARGET_URL);
  console.log('Page loaded:', await page.title());

  await page.screenshot({ path: '/tmp/screenshot.png', fullPage: true });
  console.log('📸 Screenshot saved to /tmp/screenshot.png');

  await browser.close();
})();
```

**Step 3: Execute from skill directory**

```bash
cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js /tmp/playwright-test-page.js
```

## Common Patterns

### Test a Page (Multiple Viewports)

```javascript
// /tmp/playwright-test-responsive.js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

const TARGET_URL = 'http://localhost:3001'; // Auto-detected

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false, slowMo: 100 });
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Desktop test
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });
  await page.goto(TARGET_URL);
  console.log('Desktop - Title:', await page.title());
  await page.screenshot({ path: '/tmp/desktop.png', fullPage: true });

  // Mobile test
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });
  await page.screenshot({ path: '/tmp/mobile.png', fullPage: true });

  await browser.close();
})();
```

### Test Login Flow

```javascript
// /tmp/playwright-test-login.js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

const TARGET_URL = 'http://localhost:3001'; // Auto-detected

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.goto(`${TARGET_URL}/login`);

  await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'test@example.com');
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'password123');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  // Wait for redirect
  await page.waitForURL('**/dashboard');
  console.log('✅ Login successful, redirected to dashboard');

  await browser.close();
})();
```

### Fill and Submit Form

```javascript
// /tmp/playwright-test-form.js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

const TARGET_URL = 'http://localhost:3001'; // Auto-detected

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false, slowMo: 50 });
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.goto(`${TARGET_URL}/contact`);

  await page.fill('input[name="name"]', 'John Doe');
  await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'john@example.com');
  await page.fill('textarea[name="message"]', 'Test message');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  // Verify submission
  await page.waitForSelector('.success-message');
  console.log('✅ Form submitted successfully');

  await browser.close();
})();
```

### Check for Broken Links

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');

  const links = await page.locator('a[href^="http"]').all();
  const results = { working: 0, broken: [] };

  for (const link of links) {
    const href = await link.getAttribute('href');
    try {
      const response = await page.request.head(href);
      if (response.ok()) {
        results.working++;
      } else {
        results.broken.push({ url: href, status: response.status() });
      }
    } catch (e) {
      results.broken.push({ url: href, error: e.message });
    }
  }

  console.log(`✅ Working links: ${results.working}`);
  console.log(`❌ Broken links:`, results.broken);

  await browser.close();
})();
```

### Take Screenshot with Error Handling

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  try {
    await page.goto('http://localhost:3000', {
      waitUntil: 'networkidle',
      timeout: 10000,
    });

    await page.screenshot({
      path: '/tmp/screenshot.png',
      fullPage: true,
    });

    console.log('📸 Screenshot saved to /tmp/screenshot.png');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Error:', error.message);
  } finally {
    await browser.close();
  }
})();
```

### Test Responsive Design

```javascript
// /tmp/playwright-test-responsive-full.js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

const TARGET_URL = 'http://localhost:3001'; // Auto-detected

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  const viewports = [
    { name: 'Desktop', width: 1920, height: 1080 },
    { name: 'Tablet', width: 768, height: 1024 },
    { name: 'Mobile', width: 375, height: 667 },
  ];

  for (const viewport of viewports) {
    console.log(
      `Testing ${viewport.name} (${viewport.width}x${viewport.height})`,
    );

    await page.setViewportSize({
      width: viewport.width,
      height: viewport.height,
    });

    await page.goto(TARGET_URL);
    await page.waitForTimeout(1000);

    await page.screenshot({
      path: `/tmp/${viewport.name.toLowerCase()}.png`,
      fullPage: true,
    });
  }

  console.log('✅ All viewports tested');
  await browser.close();
})();
```

## Inline Execution (Simple Tasks)

For quick one-off tasks, you can execute code inline without creating files:

```bash
# Take a quick screenshot
cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js "
const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('http://localhost:3001');
await page.screenshot({ path: '/tmp/quick-screenshot.png', fullPage: true });
console.log('Screenshot saved');
await browser.close();
"
```

**When to use inline vs files:**

- **Inline**: Quick one-off tasks (screenshot, check if element exists, get page title)
- **Files**: Complex tests, responsive design checks, anything user might want to re-run

## Available Helpers

Optional utility functions in `lib/helpers.js`:

```javascript
const helpers = require('./lib/helpers');

// Detect running dev servers (CRITICAL - use this first!)
const servers = await helpers.detectDevServers();
console.log('Found servers:', servers);

// Safe click with retry
await helpers.safeClick(page, 'button.submit', { retries: 3 });

// Safe type with clear
await helpers.safeType(page, '#username', 'testuser');

// Take timestamped screenshot
await helpers.takeScreenshot(page, 'test-result');

// Handle cookie banners
await helpers.handleCookieBanner(page);

// Extract table data
const data = await helpers.extractTableData(page, 'table.results');
```

See `lib/helpers.js` for full list.

## Custom HTTP Headers

Configure custom headers for all HTTP requests via environment variables. Useful for:

- Identifying automated traffic to your backend
- Getting LLM-optimized responses (e.g., plain text errors instead of styled HTML)
- Adding authentication tokens globally

### Configuration

**Single header (common case):**

```bash
PW_HEADER_NAME=X-Automated-By PW_HEADER_VALUE=playwright-skill \
  cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js /tmp/my-script.js
```

**Multiple headers (JSON format):**

```bash
PW_EXTRA_HEADERS='{"X-Automated-By":"playwright-skill","X-Debug":"true"}' \
  cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js /tmp/my-script.js
```

### How It Works

Headers are automatically applied when using `helpers.createContext()`:

```javascript
const context = await helpers.createContext(browser);
const page = await context.newPage();
// All requests from this page include your custom headers
```

For scripts using raw Playwright API, use the injected `getContextOptionsWithHeaders()`:

```javascript
const context = await browser.newContext(
  getContextOptionsWithHeaders({ viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 } }),
);
```

- Mobile device emulation
- Performance testing
- Debugging techniques
- CI/CD integration

## Tips

- **CRITICAL: Detect servers FIRST** - Always run `detectDevServers()` before writing test code for localhost testing
- **Custom headers** - Use `PW_HEADER_NAME`/`PW_HEADER_VALUE` env vars to identify automated traffic to your backend
- **Use /tmp for test files** - Write to `/tmp/playwright-test-*.js`, never to skill directory or user's project
- **Parameterize URLs** - Put detected/provided URL in a `TARGET_URL` constant at the top of every script
- **DEFAULT: Visible browser** - Always use `headless: false` unless user explicitly asks for headless mode
- **Headless mode** - Only use `headless: true` when user specifically requests "headless" or "background" execution
- **Slow down:** Use `slowMo: 100` to make actions visible and easier to follow
- **Wait strategies:** Use `waitForURL`, `waitForSelector`, `waitForLoadState` instead of fixed timeouts
- **Error handling:** Always use try-catch for robust automation
- **Console output:** Use `console.log()` to track progress and show what's happening

## Troubleshooting

**Playwright not installed:**

```bash
cd $SKILL_DIR && npm run setup
```

**Module not found:**
Ensure running from skill directory via `run.js` wrapper

**Browser doesn't open:**
Check `headless: false` and ensure display available

**Element not found:**
Add wait: `await page.waitForSelector('.element', { timeout: 10000 })`

## Example Usage

```
User: "Test if the marketing page looks good"

Claude: I'll test the marketing page across multiple viewports. Let me first detect running servers...
[Runs: detectDevServers()]
[Output: Found server on port 3001]
I found your dev server running on http://localhost:3001

[Writes custom automation script to /tmp/playwright-test-marketing.js with URL parameterized]
[Runs: cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js /tmp/playwright-test-marketing.js]
[Shows results with screenshots from /tmp/]
```

```
User: "Check if login redirects correctly"

Claude: I'll test the login flow. First, let me check for running servers...
[Runs: detectDevServers()]
[Output: Found servers on ports 3000 and 3001]
I found 2 dev servers. Which one should I test?
- http://localhost:3000
- http://localhost:3001

User: "Use 3001"

[Writes login automation to /tmp/playwright-test-login.js]
[Runs: cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js /tmp/playwright-test-login.js]
[Reports: ✅ Login successful, redirected to /dashboard]
```

## Notes

- Each automation is custom-written for your specific request
- Not limited to pre-built scripts - any browser task possible
- Auto-detects running dev servers to eliminate hardcoded URLs
- Test scripts written to `/tmp` for automatic cleanup (no clutter)
- Code executes reliably with proper module resolution via `run.js`
- Progressive disclosure - API_REFERENCE.md loaded only when advanced features needed

## Rules

- [playwright-skill-00001] Before running a Playwright script against a local server (especially one you just started), verify the server is fully responsive by running a quick health check (e.g., `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://localhost:PORT`) and confirming a 200 response. This prevents race conditions where the browser hits the server before it's ready to serve content.
- [playwright-skill-00002] When taking screenshots for verification purposes (e.g., dashboards, landing pages, reports), always use `fullPage: true` in the screenshot options. Content often extends below the viewport fold, and a viewport-only screenshot can miss important sections.
- [playwright-skill-00003] After capturing a screenshot with Playwright, read/view the image to visually verify that the expected content actually rendered correctly before reporting success or proceeding with further actions (like commits). Don't assume a successful screenshot means the page rendered properly — it could be blank, show an error, or have missing content.

- [playwright-skill-00004] When testing hover-triggered UI elements (tooltips, popovers, dropdown menus), use `page.hover()` on the trigger element and add a brief wait (e.g., `await page.waitForTimeout(500)`) before taking the screenshot to ensure the hover-triggered content has fully rendered. For CSS-only tooltips using pseudo-elements like `::after`, take screenshots both with and without the hover state to verify correct appearance. Consider using element-level screenshots (e.g., `element.screenshot()`) or localized area screenshots rather than full-page captures when verifying tooltips — this focuses on the exact area and makes visual verification faster and more precise.
- [playwright-skill-00005] When capturing screenshots of pages with dynamically rendered content (charts, animations, canvas elements), wait for the container element with `waitForSelector()` AND add an additional delay (e.g., `await page.waitForTimeout(3000)`) to allow animations and rendering to complete. A visible DOM element does not mean its content has finished rendering. If multiple screenshots are affected by timing issues, retake all of them for consistency rather than just fixing one.
- [playwright-skill-00006] Before starting a local HTTP server for Playwright testing, check if the target port is already in use (e.g., `lsof -ti:<port>`) and kill any stale processes. If the port is occupied, either free it or try an alternative port. Consider checking port availability proactively rather than failing and retrying through multiple ports sequentially.
- [playwright-skill-00007] When testing SPAs with client-side routing (hash-based routes like `#/page`), navigate by using `page.evaluate(() => window.location.hash = '#/target')` or by clicking navigation elements rather than using `page.goto()` with fragment URLs, as `goto` may cause full page reloads that break SPA state.
- [playwright-skill-00008] When running a test-before-push or test-and-deploy workflow, clean up all test artifacts after success — including temp scripts in /tmp, screenshots, and any local servers started for testing. Use `kill` on server PIDs and `rm` on temp files to avoid polluting the working directory or leaving orphan processes.
- [playwright-skill-00009] When testing interactive UI features (expandable rows, tabs, accordions, multi-step forms), write multi-step test scripts that simulate sequential user interactions and take screenshots at each state. This verifies both the interaction logic and the visual rendering at each step, not just the initial page load.
- [playwright-skill-00010] When verifying UI changes across multiple data variations (e.g., different eval types, user roles, filter states), take screenshots of each variation rather than just one representative case. This confirms the fix or feature works universally and catches edge cases in data-driven rendering.
- [playwright-skill-00011] When Playwright tests reveal JavaScript errors (e.g., 'Unexpected end of input', null reference errors), use those errors as direct debugging signals to fix the underlying code. Check for null/undefined data in dynamic content, especially with older or edge-case records, and add null guards proactively. Playwright serves as an effective integration debugging tool, not just a visual verification tool.
- [playwright-skill-00012] When testing a dashboard or app served from a non-standard location (e.g., git worktree, different branch build), verify that the port used in the Playwright script matches the port being actively served and that the server is serving the correct/expected version of the content. Mismatched ports can lead to testing stale content from a different server instance.

- [playwright-skill-00013] When auditing or inventorying a dashboard with many views/tabs (e.g., 10+), write a single comprehensive Playwright script that navigates through ALL views in sequence and captures screenshots for each, rather than running separate scripts per view. This is more efficient, avoids repeated browser launch overhead, and ensures consistent server/session state across all captures.
- [playwright-skill-00014] When using Playwright screenshots for audit or inventory purposes (rather than bug-finding), extract structured data from the visual inspection — create tables, summaries, or catalogs of what's found (e.g., metrics, scoring methods, component types, feature lists) rather than just confirming 'it looks right'. Treat the screenshots as a data source to produce actionable documentation, not just a pass/fail check.
